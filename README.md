# pandemicSimulation

Hello! This is my Pandemic Simulation. It, of course, simulates how a pandemic might spread depending on different variables. It demonstrates this is a vary useful way. You can view the simulation take place or view a graph of the individuals in the simulation as it hapens. To switch between these, click any key except for space -- space will pause or unpause the program. Have fun!

At the moment the only way to change the values is through changing the code. To do this you will need the Processing IDE. If you would like to download it, go here --> https://processing.org/download/.
